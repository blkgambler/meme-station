Hello gentlemen !

Most of you must know me from previous threads, or simply by my legendary reputation.

I offer accurate, worldwide recognized evaluation of your Rare PePes. (I can also give authenticity certificates)

I am also here to answer any of your questions on Rare PePes, Wild Rare PePes,etc.

I am well known here and my worldwide reputation as the best PePe trader in the century and for those to come speaks for itself, which is why you probably already known who I am.

Sincerely yours,

No. It is illegal to create your own PePes without the proper authorization. (in which case they are worth nothing) You either have to prove yourself a worthy artist, then you can apply to receive an authorization, or you have to be certified as a PePe Factory (which is nowadays almost impossible).

The production of PePes without the right certificate/authorization is punished by death within the next 3 days, in every country on earth.




Hello fellow enthusiast !

I am glad to see that you are looking forward into building a PePe collection.

I would suggest you start by collecting Semi-Common to Semi-Rare PePes, they can be found between 250 ETH and 3000 ETH.

It is a good way to start a collection with which you can eventually start trading.

Good luck to you, fellow PePe collector.

Feel free to ask any questions!

With love,
PepeLorDTradEr-J1
